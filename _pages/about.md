Hi there! I'm now a third-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Technology at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Fang Bai](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree 
in Biomedical Engineering from ShanghaiTech University in 2022. My research interests 
focus on **Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Design(AIDD)**, including:
- **AI methods for protein-nucleic acid interactions**: the binding site prediction and generation of nucleic acids.
- **Protein representation learning**, especially geometric representation based on protein structure.
