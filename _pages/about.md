Hi there! My name is Xinyue Ma (马欣悦). I am currently a third-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">ShanghaiTech University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">Prof. Fang Bai</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from ShanghaiTech University in 2022. <br /> 
</p>

My research interests focus on <b>Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Design(AIDD)</b>, including:
- <b>AI methods for protein-nucleic acid interactions</b>: the binding site prediction and generation of nucleic acids.
- <b>Protein representation learning</b>, especially geometric representation based on protein structure.
