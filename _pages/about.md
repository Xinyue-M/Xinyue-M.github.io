Hi there! I'm now a third-year Ph.D student in Computer Science and Technology at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Fang Bai](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). I received my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from ShanghaiTech University in 2022. My research interests focus on **Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Design(AIDD)**, including:

- AI methods for protein-nucleic acid interactions: the binding site prediction and generation of nucleic acids.
- Protein representation learning, especially geometric representation based on protein structure.
