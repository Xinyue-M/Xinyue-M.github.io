My research interests focus on **Artificial Intelligence-Driven Drug Design(AIDD)**, including:
- **AI methods for protein-nucleic acid interactions**: the binding site prediction and generation of nucleic acids.
- **Protein representation learning**, especially geometric representation based on protein structure. <br />
